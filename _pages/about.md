Hi there! I'm Shoaib and I'm from Pakistan. I'm currently a Masters student with the **Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters in Astrophysics and Space Science** ([MASS](https://www.master-mass.eu/)) programme. The programme is constituted by a consortium of four universities. So far, I have spent time at the **University of Rome "Tor Vergata"**, Italy, and the **University of Belgrade**, Serbia.

I'm fascinated with the intersection of **Scientific Computation and Astronomy**, and I'm working towards a career researching deep learning, algorithms, simulations, data pipelines, and software within astrophysics.

I earned my Bachelors in Astrophysics from **Haverford College**, USA in 2021 with a concentration in Scientific Computing. I enjoy tech gadgets, South Asian history, and cooking for my friends.
